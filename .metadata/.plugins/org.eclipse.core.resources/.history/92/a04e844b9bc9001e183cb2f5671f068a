//The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, 
//known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, known as observers, 
//that are notified of any changes in the subject's state

/*
 * example:- Youtbe and subscriber,
 * when Video is uploaded on youtube channel all subscriber gets notified 
 * 
 */
